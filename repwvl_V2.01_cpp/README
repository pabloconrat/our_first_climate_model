* repwvl V2.01 -- use representative wavelengths instead of full line-by-line spectrum
  (Bachelor Thesis Michael de Mourgues, 02/212021)

* void read_tau (...) returns an array of wavelengths, optical thicknesses and weights;
  integrated thermal irradiance E is calculated as
  E = sum ( weight[iv] * radiance ( B(wvl[iv]), tau[ilyr][iv] ) )
  Note that radiances must be given in W / (m2 nm)!

* wavelengths wvl[nm], pressure [Pa], mixing ratio in absolute units (0.0004 instead of 400 ppm)

* all quantities (except pLev) are either level quantities (if prop_at_lev is 1) 
  or layer quantities (if prop_at_lev is 0); pLev is always level quantity

* compile example which only integrates Planck function at the surface using compile script compile.sh

* C++ code needs to be compiled and linked with g++
