* repwvl V1.0 -- use representative wavelengths instead of full line-by-line spectrum
  (Bachelor Thesis Michael de Mourgues, 01/2021)

* void read_tau (...) returns an array of wavelengths, optical thicknesses and weights;
  integrated thermal irradiance E is calculated as
  E =  sum ( weight[iv] * radiative transfer ( B(wvl[iv]), tau[ilyr][iv] ) )

* wavelengths wvl[nm], pressure [Pa], mixing ratio in absolute units (0.0004 instead of 400 ppm)

* compile example which only integrates Planck function at the surface using compile script compile.sh

* C++ code needs to be compiled and linked with g++
