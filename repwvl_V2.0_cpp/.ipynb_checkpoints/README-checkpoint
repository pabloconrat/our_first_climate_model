* repwvl V2.0 -- use representative wavelengths instead of full line-by-line spectrum
  (Bachelor Thesis Michael de Mourgues, 02/212021)

* void read_tau (...) returns an array of wavelengths, optical thicknesses and weights;
  integrated thermal irradiance E is calculated as
  E = sum ( weight[iv] * radiance ( B(wvl[iv]), tau[ilyr][iv] ) )
  Note that radiances must be given in W / (m2 nm)!

* wavelengths wvl[nm], pressure [Pa], mixing ratio in absolute units (0.0004 instead of 400 ppm)

* all levels are level quantities except the temperature which is either a level quantity
  (if T_at_lev is different from 0) or a layer quantity (if T_at_lev is 0)

* compile example which only integrates Planck function at the surface using compile script compile.sh

* C++ code needs to be compiled and linked with g++
